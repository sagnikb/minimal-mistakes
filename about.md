Hi! I am Sagnik. I am now a graduate student in ECE and ISR at UMD, working on information theory. Till the spring of 2019, I was an undergraduate student in the Electrical Engineering department of IIT Kanpur. Apart from my main research area, I maintain academic interests in theoretical computer science, linguistics and history.

My non-academic interests include reading, writing, travelling and Indian classical music. I sometimes also draw.
