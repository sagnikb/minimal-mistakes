**The Lovasz Theta function, a pentagon and an umbrella** - An introduction to zero-error information theory and the problem of finding the Shannon capacity of the pentagon, and how it was resolved by Lovasz and his theta function. Presented at <a href="https://schiitk.github.io/">Science Coffeehouse, IIT Kanpur</a> <a href="/assets/pdfs/lovasz.pdf">[notes]</a>

**Approximate Degree of Polynomials and Quantum Query Complexity** - Survey talk regarding approximate of polynomials, it’s relationship with quantum query complexity and an explicit construction of an approximating polynomial for the OR function. <a href="/assets/pdfs/UGP_presentation_CSE.pdf">[slides]</a>

**Quantum Information Theory** - Introductory talk on the resource theory of quantum information, given as a part of a Quantum Computing course.  <a href="/assets/pdfs/sagnik_QC_endterm.pdf">[slides]</a>

**Noisy quantum systems** - Introductory talk on density matrices and how they allow us to handle ‘real-life’ quantum mechanics where no state is pure. Also introduces quantum channels. Given as a part of a Quantum Computing course.  <a href="/assets/pdfs/sagnik_QC_midterm.pdf">[slides]</a>

**Evolutionary dynamics of language** - Survey talk on the Nowak-Niyogi-Komarova model of language evolution, including an overview of the model, known results and possible extensions. Given as part of a Psychology of Language course. <a href="http://home.iitk.ac.in/~sagnikb/PSY499/PSY499-End-term-Presentation.pdf">[slides]</a>
