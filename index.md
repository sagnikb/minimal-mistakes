<h1 style="font-family:'Atma'"> সাগ্নিক ভট্টাচার্য্য </h1>
I am a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof Prakash Narayan](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~prakash/index.html). I am broadly interested in Information Theory and Quantum Computing. I did my BTech in Electrical Engineering during four wonderful years at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).

I spent the summer of 2018 at [CUHK](http://www.cuhk.edu.hk/english/index.html) in Hong Kong, working with [Prof Sidharth Jaggi](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~sjaggi/) on [communication using common randomness in the presence of an adversary](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8849801).

I have worked with [Prof Adrish Banerjee](https://home.iitk.ac.in/~adrish) on finding [bounds on codes in the Lee metric](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8849817) and with <a href="https://www.cse.iitk.ac.in/users/rmittal/">Prof Rajat Mittal</a> on quantum query complexity lower bounds.

I have a blog called [Thoughts, Quantized](/blog).
