<h1 style="font-family:'Atma'"> সাগ্নিক ভট্টাচার্য্য </h1>

I am a first-year Electrical and Computer Engineering PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park, advised by [Prof Prakash Narayan](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~prakash/index.html). I am broadly interested in Information Theory and Quantum Computing. I am also interested in Boolean functions and the intersection of statistical physics, theoretical computer science and coding theory. I did my BTech in Electrical Engineering during four wonderful years at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur](http://www.iitk.ac.in/).

My [CV](/assets/cv.pdf).

### Blog

I have a blog called [Thoughts, Quantized](/blog), which contains posts about my research, life, music, puzzles and personal travel stories. I also sometimes write on [Medium](#link), when I think more people might be interested in the topic.

### Research

I have worked on 
* *algebraic coding theory*, finding bounds on the sizes of spheres in the Lee metric
* *adversarial channels*, finding bounds on the amount of common randomness required to communicate in the presence of an adversary
* *quantum query complexity*, finding lower bounds on the query complexity of interesting functions.

Read more [here](/research). My list of publications is available [here](#). A list of talks I have given can be found [here](/talks).

### Personal

Some of my non-academic interests can be found in [The Trove](/trove).

I wrote an essay about some memories and life-lessons that I accumulated in my four years at IIT Kanpur which [got published by Vox Populi](http://voxiitk.com/as-we-leave-9/), the campus journalism body.
