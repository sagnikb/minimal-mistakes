I am a second year ECE PhD student at the University of Maryland, College Park, working on sampling/rate-distortion problems, advised by [Prof Prakash Narayan](https://user.eng.umd.edu/~prakash/index.html).

I am broadly interested in classical and quantum information theory. I have previously worked on and maintain an interest in algebraic coding theory, adversarial channels and quantum query complexity.

I graduated with a Bachelor of Technology in Electrical Engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur in June 2019. I was advised by [Prof Adrish Banerjee](http://home.iitk.ac.in/~adrish/) during this time, and also spent a summer at CUHK, working with [Prof Sidharth Jaggi](https://staff.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/~sjaggi/).
