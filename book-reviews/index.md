This book gives the same look at some people who saw the 2008 financial crisis coming, and it is a fascinating look, filled with colourful characters. It is also complicated to follow, but I guess that's necessary; a thesis of the book is that the crisis itself happened because the people in the middle of it did not know what they were doing. I will be reading it again, because...
